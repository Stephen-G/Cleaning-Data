## This ReadME describes the run_analysis.R script

The script will load the data file from the working directory where the data files have been unzipped

Then the script will combine the data sets into their respective categories

Once the data is combined, columns names are filtered and cleaned

The script will then take the cleaned data sets and combine them into on TidyData frame

This script will also calculate the averages for the TidyData set based on Subject and Activity and write this table to Averages.txt
